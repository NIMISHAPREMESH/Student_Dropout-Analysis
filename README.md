# Student_Dropout-Analysis - Classification Model

# Project Overview:
This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify students at risk of dropping out of school using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset containing various student-related factors

# Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information on 4424 students across several attributes like gender, age, nationality, qualifications, academic performance, etc. More details on the data dictionary can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention Â  

# Objective 
To develop a machine learning model that accurately identifies students at risk of dropping out based on various factors. The target variable in the model includes three categories: Graduate, Dropout, and Enrolled.

# Methodology:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data
Feature engineering to create new informative features
Model selection and training (Logistic Regression,Support Vector Machine,RandomForestClassifier,Gradient Boosting,MLP Classifier,Decession Tree Classifier,KNN Classifier)
Model evaluation using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

# Project Structure:
data: Contains the original dataset and preprocessed data
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling
models: Saved trained models
results: Model evaluation results
